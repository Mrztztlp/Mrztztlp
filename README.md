- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mrztztlp
- 👀 I'm interested in deflationary systems that make it possible to develop technologies and networks where everyone can contribute their ideas.
     
     We can create a world with independent systems and freedom to develop technologies that can be further developed by everyone through plugins and adapted to their individual        interests.
- 🌱 I'm learning basic programming techniques
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bitcoin Technolegies
